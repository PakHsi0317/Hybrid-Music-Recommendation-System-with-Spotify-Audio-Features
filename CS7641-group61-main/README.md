`/MLProject/` - contains all code files

`/requirements.txt` - required packages 

`/MLProject/preprocessing.py` - dataset preprocessing functionality, merging datasets

`/MLProject/preprocessing.ipynb` - sample usage of preprocessing.py, with saving preprocessed data

`/MLProject/MBCF.py` - contains training/test pipelinee for model-base collaborative filtering.

`/MLProject/MBCFVisual***.py` - contains visualization of output results. 

`/MLProject/supervised_neural_network.py` - contains training/testing pipeline for the hybrid neural network. There's also an evaluation function to measure the metrics that we use to compare both supervised and unsupervised models e.g. hitrate@k.

`/MLProject/train_supervised_nn.ipynb` - This file allows you to execute the functions inside /MLProject/supervised_neural_network.py. It contains cells that will read the data, process it, run the training and testing, then perform evaluation. 

`/MLProject/unsupervised_recommender_viz.py` - Implements unsupervised recommendation models (NMF and Item-CF) with evaluation metrics initially and visualization of performance and interaction distributions.

`/MLProject/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` - exploratory data analysis, heatmap of features, feature distribution plots

`/MLProject/diagram.py` - generate item_popularity_hist and user_interactions_hist graphs

`/MLProject/als_renew.py` - build and train ALS model
