# Hybrid-Music-Recommendation-System-with-Spotify-Audio-Features
Developed and evaluated a hybrid music recommender system combining collaborative filtering and content-based audio features. Integrated TIMJ implicit feedback with Spotify track attributes, implemented ALS and neural models, and measured performance using HitRate, NDCG, and MRR to address sparsity and cold-start issues.
